# Crypto-Wallet-Scam-Flooder
Floods a crypto wallet scam site with fake wallet recovery keys.

I got tired of seeing fake emails from 'MetaMask' every week in my inbox - from a new domain every time. Presumably the same person as the website looks and functions exactly the same every time.

To try to prevent the hacker from seeing legitimate wallet recovery keys from gullible / less tech-savvy people, I developed a small script to flood them with fake recovery keys hopefully making it more difficult for the hacker to distinguish between legitimate and fake keys.

Designed to work with the specific website I keep seeing, but can probably be modified to work with other similar scams.

When doing this, make sure to also:
* [Report the URL to Google](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/) to warn Chrome / Chromium-based browser users that the site is illegitimate
* [Lookup the domain and find the registrar abuse contact email](https://whois.domaintools.com/) to get the site taken down
